# Bird_Atlas_BCR_BBS_data_2018_2022

## Introduction
The North American Bird Atlas presented here is the culmination of a comprehensive process involving extracting and analyzing raw data from the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), facilitated by SaveBirds.app. Utilizing the Bird Atlas Generator, a service offered by SaveBirds.app, we have transformed this data into detailed atlases that provide invaluable insights into bird species across North America. This effort underscores our commitment to avian conservation and the innovative use of data to foster understanding and awareness.
